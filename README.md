# Martyr VTT
This is a web app that I am building to support the development, prototyping, and playtesting of *Martyr*, a TTRPG I am designing. I have found that existing virtual tabletops lack the vast majority of features required by the *Martyr* ruleset, and instead of developing plugins or mods for existing VTTs, it feels like a more flexible and efficient use of my time to instead build a custom VTT that is ligher weight and more focused on the actual mechanics of my game.

## About Martyr
Martyr is a character-driven narrative tabletop role-playing game. It's primary design goal is to formalize narrativist game mechanics, and focus its complexity on the elements of the TTRPG experience that differentiate TTRPGs from other categories and styles of game.

Some ideas that I am working through in the Martyr design process are:
- **Inversion of the mechanics-as-narrative game design paradigm.** Instead of viewing the mechanical actions of players as a baseline source of narrative inspiration, *Martyr* seeks to instead construct a mechanical scene-description framework that unifies game mechanics and narrative events into a single, inseparable system.
- **Making the implicit explicit.** The impact of a narrative is strongly correlated to the clarity that observers and players have into what is going on -- the themes, motifs, tension, and release of a story are only impactful so far as the audience can identify the themes and motifs, and moments of tension and release. Rather than allow players to freely improvise these narrative elements, *Martyr* seeks to state its purpose and stakes up front, and expose the inner workings of emergent narrative systems.

Martyr is unlikely to ever get published. I'm mostly designing it because it's a game that I want to play, and among the many TTRPGs out there, I have yet to find one that really does what I want it to do. 

## About the VTT
I am building this virtual tabletop as an easily accessible vehicle for playtesting. Rather than require playtesters to play in person, print materials, or acquire specialized equipment (namely, blank, disposable playing cards), I want the barrier to entry to be as low as possible. 

Right now it's just a React app with Firebase as its auth and database backend.
